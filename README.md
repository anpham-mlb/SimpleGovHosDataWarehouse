## Purpose
Build a data warehouse for analyzing trends and forecasting purposes to identify which frequently used services and popular hospital locations. The statistics include the total number of patients, total service charged by services used, time periods, age groups, and hospital locations.

The data was taken from some of the most popular hospitals in Melbourne such as The Alfred Hospital, Caulfield Hospital, Sandringham Hospital, The Royal Melbourne Hospital - Royal Park Campus, The Royal Melbourne Hospital - City Campus, Box Hill Hospital and Casey Hospital.

### Step 1
Build an ER diagram from collective data of all government-run hospitals (figure 1).

### Step 2
- Create the operational database based on the E/R Diagram using SQL.
- Develop a GOVERNMENT HOSPITAL star schema (figure 2).
- Create the fact and dimension tables using SQL.

## Result
From the data warehouse, users are able to know some information such as:
- The total number of patients making appointments during Winter.
- The total service charged for each service cost type.
- The total number of patients by each age group (infant <1, children <18, adult 18+, senior 65+) in April 2020.
- The total service charged for general medical consultations in each suburb.
